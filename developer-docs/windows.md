## Windows Dependencies

### System Requirements

We develop the Windows version of Pupil using **64 bit** **Windows 10**.

Therefore we can only debug and support issues for **Windows 10**.

### Notes Before Starting

- Work directory - We will make a directory called `work` at `C:\work` and will use this directory for all build processes and setup scripts. Whenever we refer to the `work` directory, it will refer to `C:\work`. You can change this to whatever is convenient for you, but note that all instructions and setup files refer to `C:\work`
- Command Prompt - We will **always** be using `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017 Preview` as our command prompt. Make sure to only use this command prompt. Unlike unix systems, windows has many possible "terminals" or "cmd prompts". We are targeting `x64` systems and require the `x64` command prompt. You can access this cmd prompt from the Visual Studio 2017 shortcut in your Start menu.
- 64bit - You should be using a 64 bit system and therefore all downloads, builds, and libraries should be for `x64` unless otherwise specified.
- Windows paths and Python - path separators in windows are a forward slash `\`. In Python, this is a special "escape" character. When specifying Windows paths in a Python string you must use `\\` instead of `\` or use [Python raw strings](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals), e.g. `r'\'`.
- Help - For discussion or questions on Windows head over to our [#pupil Discord channel](https://discord.gg/gKmmGqy). If you run into trouble please raise an [issue on github](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil)!

### Install Visual Studio

Download Visual Studio 2017 Preview version 15.3 from [visualstudio.com](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/)

- Run the Visual Studio bootstrapper `.exe`.
- Navigate to the `Workloads` tab
- In the `Workloads` tab, choose `Desktop Development with C++`. This will install all runtimes and components we need for development. Here is a list of what you should see `checked` in the `Desktop development with C++` in the `Summary` view:
    - VC++ 2017 v141 toolset (x86,x64)
    - C++ profiling tools
    - Windows 10 SDK (10.0.15063.0) for Desktop C++ x86 and x64
    - Visual C++ tools for CMAKE
    - Visual C++ ATL support
    - MFC and ATL support (x86, x64)
    - Standard Library Modules
    - VC++ 2015.3 v140 toolset for desktop (x86, x64)
- Navigate to the `Individual Components` tab
- In the `Individual Components` tab check `Git`. This will install `git` on your system. In the Summary Panel for `Individual Components` you should see:
  - `Git for Windows`
- Click `Install`

<aside class="notice">Note - You can always re-run the Visual Studio bootstrapper to modify your Visual Studio installation.</aside>

### Install 7-Zip
Install [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html) to extract files.

### Install Python

- [Download Python x64](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-361/)
- Run the Python installer.
- Check the box `Add Python to PATH`. This will add Python to your System PATH Environment Variable.
- Check the box `Install for all users`. This will install Python to `C:\Program Files\Python36`.

<aside class="notice"> Note - some build scripts may fail to start Python due to spaces in the path name. So, you may want to consider installing Python to `C:\Python36`.</aside>

### System Environment Variables

You will need to check to see that Python was added to your system PATH variables. You will also need to manually add other entries to the system PATH later in the setup process.

To access your System Environment Variables:

- Right click on the Windows icon in the system tray.
- Select `System`.
- Click on `Advanced system settings`.
- Click on `Environment Variables...`.
- You can click on `Path` in `System Variables` to view the variables that have been set.
- You can `Edit` or `Add` new paths (this is needed later in the setup process).

### Python Wheels
Most Python extensions can be installed via **pip**. We recommend to download and install the pre-built wheel (*.whl) packages maintained by [Christoph Gohlke](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/). (@Gohlke Thanks for creating and sharing these packages!)

<aside class="notice">Note - you are using Python3.6 and a Windows 64 bit system. Therefore download wheels with `cp36‑cp36m‑win_amd64.whl` in the file name. `cp36` means C Python v3.6 and `amd64` signifies 64 bit architecture.</aside>

Download the most recent version of the following wheels Python3.6 x64 systems.

- [numpy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy)
- [scipy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy)
- [boost.python](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#boost.python)
- [cython](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#cython)
- [opencv](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv)
- [pyopengl](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyopengl) (do not download pyopengl-accelerate)
- [psutil](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#psutil)
- [pyaudio](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio)
- [pyzmq](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyzmq)

Open your command prompt and `Run as administrator` in the directory where the wheels are downloaded.

- Install `numpy` and `scipy` before all other wheels.
- Install all wheels with `pip install X` (where X is the name of the `.whl` file)
- You can check that libs are installed with `python import X` statements in the command prompt where `X` is the name of the lib.

### Python Libs
Open your command prompt and install the following libs:

- `pip install msgpack_python`
- `pip install win_inet_pton`
- `pip install git+https://github.com/zeromq/pyre.git`

### Pupil Labs Python Wheels
Download the following Python wheels from Pupil Labs github repos.

- [pyglui](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyglui/releases/latest)
- [pyav](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyav/releases/latest)
- [pyndsi](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyndsi/releases/latest)
- [pyuvc](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyuvc/releases/latest)

`pyuvc` requires that you download Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable from [microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14632). The `pthreadVC2` lib, which is used by libuvc, depends on `msvcr100.dll`.

<aside class="notice">Note - if you're looking to build Pupil Labs Python libs from source, go <a href="#windows-pupil-labs-python-libs-from-source">here</a></aside>

### Ceres for Windows
Navigate to your work directory

- `git clone --recursive https://github.com/tbennun/ceres-windows.git`
- Download [Eigen 3.3.3](https://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/downloads/?tab=tags)
- Unzip Eigen and rename the contained `eigen` directory to `Eigen`
- Copy the `Eigen` directory into `ceres-windows`
- Copy `C:\work\ceres-windows\ceres-solver\config\ceres\internal\config.h` to `C:\work\ceres-windows\ceres-solver\include\ceres\internal`
- Open `ceres-2015.sln` and with Visual Studio 2017 Preview and agree to update to 2017.
- Set configurations to `Release` and `x64`
- Right click on `libglog_static` and `Build`
- Right click on `ceres_static` and `Build`

### Boost
Download and install the latest boost version for Windows x64 with version number matching your Visual Studio 2017 MSVC version.

- For VS 2017 preview the MSVC version is 14.1
- Download boost from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.64.0/boost_1_64_0-msvc-14.1-64.exe/download)
- Extract boost to work directory and name the boost dir `boost`
- Open `C:\work\boost\boost\python\detail\config.hpp` with Visual Studio 2017 Preview
- Change **L108** from `define BOOST_LIB_NAME boost_python` to `define BOOST_LIB_NAME boost_python3`
- Save the file and close Visual Studio

The prebuilt boost.python depends on `python27.dll`. The files from package boost.python are built with Visual Studio 2015. One solution to this issue is to build boost from source.

- Open your command prompt
- cd to `C:\work\boost`
- Run `boostrap.bat`. This will generate `b2.exe`.

Change user config before compiling boost.

- Copy `C:\work\boost\tools\build\example\user-config.jam` to `boost\tools\build\src\user-config.jam`.
- Uncomment and edit following lines in the `user-config.jam` file according your msvc and python version:
    - `using msvc : 14.1 ;` in section `MSVC configuration`
    - `using python : 3.6 : C:\\Python36 : C:\\Python36\\include : C:\\Python36\\libs ;` in section `Python configuration`

Build boost.python

- Open your command prompt and navigate to your work dir
- cd to `boost`
- `b2 --with-python link=shared address-model=64`
- The generated DLL and Lib files are in `C:\work\boost\stage`.

Add Boost libs to your system path

- Add `C:\work\boost\stage\lib` to your system PATH in your System Environment Variables

### Clone the Pupil Repo

- Open a command prompt in your work dir
- `git clone https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil.git`

### Setup pupil_external dependencies
Dynamic libs are required to be stored in `pupil\pupil_external` so that you do not have to add further modifications to your system PATH.

### GLEW to pupil_external
