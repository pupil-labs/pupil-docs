## MacOS Dependencies

These instructions have been tested for MacOS 10.8, 10.9, 10.10, 10.11, and 10.12. Use the linked websites and Terminal to execute the instructions.

### Install Apple Dev Tools
Trigger the install of the Command Line Tools (CLT) by typing this in your terminal and letting MacOS install the tools required:

```bash
git
```

### Install Homebrew
[Homebrew][brew] describes itself as "the missing package manager for OSX."  It makes development on MacOS much easier, [plus it's open source][brew-github].  Install with the ruby script.

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

> Install Homebrew `Python >=3.6`

```
brew install python3
```

Add Homebrew installed executables and Python scripts to your path.  Add the following two lines to your ~/.bash_profile. (you can open textedit from the terminal like so: `open ~/.bash_profile`)

    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH
    export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

<aside class="notice">
Note - You might need to change the Python path above depending on your installed version. `brew info python3 | grep site-packages` prints the corresponding site-packages folder.
