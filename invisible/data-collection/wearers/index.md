# Wearers
Wearers are the people wearing the Pupil Invisible Glasses. In a typical study, each subject would be a wearer. Every recording you make is assigned to a wearer to help you organize your recordings. You can create new wearers on the fly in the Pupil Invisible Companion app or in advance using [Pupil Cloud](/pupil-cloud/).

Every wearer is assigned a unique ID, such that you can edit the name and profile picture at any time without mixing up your recordings.

Gaze estimates for some subjects with rare physiologies can be affected by a systematic offset. In those cases you can define an **offset correction** in the wearer profile to compensate this effect. Learn more about this in the [Offset Correction guide](/data-collection/offset-correction/).
