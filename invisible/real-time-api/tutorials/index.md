## Real-Time API

Our [Real-Time API](https://github.com/pupil-labs/realtime-network-api) offers flexible approaches to access data streams 
in real time, remote control your device, send/receive trigger events and annotations, and even synchronise with other 
devices.

The fastest way to get started is with our **[Python API Client](https://pupil-labs.github.io/pl-realtime-api/dev/)**. 
The comprehensive client documentation includes:

* **[A Getting Started Guide](https://pupil-labs.github.io/pl-realtime-api/dev/getting-started/)**
* **[Code Examples and Methods](https://pupil-labs.github.io/pl-realtime-api/dev/methods/simple/)**
* **[A Cookbook with advanced examples and tools](https://pupil-labs.github.io/pl-realtime-api/dev/cookbook/)** 

We recommend all developers start here, even if you plan to use a different language, as the principles and examples 
are invaluable.

### Additional API Client

While Python is our most feature-rich client, we also provide a **[MATLAB Wrapper](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pl-neon-matlab)**.

### For Non-Developers

If you are not a developer and simply need a tool to monitor and control your devices in real-time, check out our
**[Pupil Invisible Monitor](/data-collection/monitor-app/)** application.
