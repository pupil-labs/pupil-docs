# Pupil Service
Pupil Service is like Pupil Capture except it does not have a world video feed, and comes with a slimmed down GUI. 
It is intended to be used with VR and AR eye tracking setups.

<div class="pb-4">
  <v-img :src="require('../../media/core/icons/ps.png')" style="display:flex;margin:0 auto;width:100px;"></v-img>
</div>

:::tip
<v-icon large color="info">info_outline</v-icon>
The tools introduced in the [hmd-eyes project](https://github.com/pupil-labs/hmd-eyes) are made to work with Pupil Service and Pupil Capture alike.

## Service Features
With the Pupil Service GUI you can define a [Pupil Remote Address](/developer/core/network-api/#pupil-remote)
and toggle to open and close the left and right eye windows.

<div class="pb-4">
  <v-img :src="require('../../media/core/imgs/ps-gui.jpg')" style="display:flex;margin:0 auto;width:400px"></v-img>
</div>

Note that the eye windows opened by Pupil Service are equivalent to those of Pupil Capture, giving you access to all
associated [pupil detection settings](/core/software/pupil-capture/#fine-tuning-pupil-detection).

A powerful feature of Pupil Service is low latency gaze mapping â€“ Pupil Service maps gaze as soon as a new pupil datum 
is available. Pupil Capture, on the other hand, queues incoming pupil data until the scene camera returns a new frame. Afterward, the queued pupil data is mapped in bulk. 

Pupil Service also uses less system resources. 

Check out the [Network API documentation](/developer/core/network-api/#communicating-with-pupil-service) for examples of 
communicating with Pupil Service!
