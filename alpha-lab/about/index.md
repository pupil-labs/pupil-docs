      "Pupil Labs is made up of naturally curious people. We enjoy building prototypes, testing out novel ideas, and creating demos to explore our curiosities. We regularly speak with and learn from our users, gaining insights about what’s in demand. Sometimes, these develop into prototypes that you will find here!",
      "Alpha Lab is not a place for official product documentation. Everything you find here should be considered a work in progress. We encourage you to read, play, and build from the ideas – hack away!",
