## Player Workflow
Use Pupil Player to visualize data recorded with Pupil Capture and export videos of visualization and datasets for further analysis. 

### 1. Open Pupil Player

> {{< figure-img src="/images/icons/svg/pp.svg" img-class="feature-center logo" width="20%" >}}

Now that you have recorded some data, you can play back the video and visualize gaze data, marker data, and more.

#### Visualize

Player comes with a number of plugins. Plugins are classified by their use-case. Visualization plugins can be additive. This means that you can add multiple instances of a plugin to build up a visualization.

#### Where are Pupil Player exports saved?

> {{< webp-img src="/images/pupil-player/recording/export_folder.jpg" >}}

Exports are saved within a dedicated folder named `exports` within the original recording folder.

Each export is contained within a folder within the `exports` folder. The numbers of the export correlate to the trim marks (frame start and frame end) for the export.
