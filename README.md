# Recommended Defaults
- When importing images, use markdown-style imports
```markdown
![alt text](/path/to/image.png)
```
- When trying to create a gallery view, consider using the `PhotoGrid` component
- Avoid using custom HTML and CSS as much as possible.


# Capitalization
- We use title case for all titles, headings, menu sections etc. We use title case as it is defined by the Associated Press Stylebook. There is a converter available [here](https://titlecaseconverter.com/) to double-check correctness.
- Fixed product and feature names are capitalized, like e.g.
    - Reference Image Mapper
    - Neon Companion App
    - Neon Companion Device
    - Pupil Invisible Glasses
    - Video Renderer
    - Heatmap Visualization
