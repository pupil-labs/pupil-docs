# Headless Mode

There might be instances where you want to use Neon Player's powerful data processing capabilities without the need for a graphical user interface. This is where headless mode comes in.

You can run Neon Player in headless mode using the command line interface (CLI), which allows you to process recordings, extract data, and generate visualizations without launching the full application. This is particularly useful for batch processing multiple recordings or integrating Neon Player's functionality into automated workflows.
