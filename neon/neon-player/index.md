# Neon Player

![Neon Player Banner](./banner.webp)

[Neon Player](https://github.com/pupil-labs/neon-player) is a cross-platform desktop application for playing back, analyzing, and exporting Neon recordings. It runs entirely offline: all data stays on the local machine, and no interaction with Pupil Cloud is required.

The application is designed to provide an intuitive way to work with Neon recordings locally.

It is scalable and extensible through a plugin architecture, allowing users to add / disable streams on demand, add custom visualizations, data processing, or export functionalities.
