# Exports

You can export data for every plugin individually, or you can use the `Export All` plugin to export all data together.

You can press the export icon symbol, which prompts you to select a location to save the data.

- If exporting from an individual plugin, relevant CSV file's will be saved to the selected location.

- If exporting from the `Export All` plugin, it will create a new folder with the title of the current timestamp. All loaded plugins with export capabilities will initiate the export process and save their data to this folder.

During the export, you can continue to work with Neon Player.

::: info
The exported data follows [Data Format](../../data-collection/data-format/) with some minor adjustments.
