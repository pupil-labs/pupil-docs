# Exports

Data can be exported individually for specific plugins or collectively using the `Export All` plugin.

To begin, click an Export icon and select a destination for the data:
- **Individual Export:** The relevant `.csv` files are saved directly to the selected location.
- **Export All:** A new folder is created named with the current timestamp. All active plugins with export capabilities will save their data into this folder.

You can continue working in Neon Player while the export runs in the background.


::: info
The exported data follows [Data Format](../../data-collection/data-format/) with some minor adjustments.
