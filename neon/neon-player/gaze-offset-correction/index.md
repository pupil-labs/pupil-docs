# Post-Hoc Offset Correction

Post-hoc [Offset Correction](../../data-collection/offset-correction/) is possible with Neon Player. The offset 
correction is a simple translation of the raw gaze signal. To use this feature, navigate to the 'Gaze Data' plugin and 
drag the sliders until the gaze offset is correctly applied. Offset corrected gaze will subsequently be used by any plugins 
that leverage gaze data, such as Fixations & Saccades, and Surface Tracker.
