# Post-Hoc Offset Correction

Post-hoc [Offset Correction](../../data-collection/offset-correction/) is possible with Neon Player. The offset 
correction is a simple two-dimensional translation of the raw gaze signal. To use this feature,
navigate to the 'Gaze Data' plugin and drag the sliders until the gaze offset is correctly applied. Offset corrected gaze
will subsequently be used by any plugins that leverage gaze data, such as the Fixation Detector and Surface Tracker Plugins.
