# Wearers
Wearers are the people wearing Neon. In a typical study, each subject would be a wearer. Every recording you make is assigned to a wearer to help you organize your recordings. You can create new wearers on the fly in the Neon Companion app or in advance using [Pupil Cloud](/pupil-cloud/).

Every wearer is assigned a unique ID, such that you can edit the name and profile picture at any time without mixing up your recordings.

Wearer profiles also allow you to save **physiological parameters** of a subject in order to improve the quality of the eye tracking data. The inter eye distance (IED) for example can be entered to improve the accuracy of [pupil diameter](/general/data-streams/#pupil-diameters) estimates (see [here](/data-collection/measuring-the-IED/) for a tutorial on that).

Gaze estimates for some subjects with rare physiologies can be affected by a systematic offset. In those cases you can define an **offset correction** in the wearer profile to compensate this effect. Learn more about this in the [Offset Correction guide](/data-collection/offset-correction/).
