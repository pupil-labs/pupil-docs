Welcome to the Neon Developer documentation! Neon is quite easy to work with for developers and range of resources are available to kickstart your process.

Besides the APIs and libraries listed below, also check out [AlphaLab](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/alpha-lab/), which contains many open-source implementations of experimental features and demo applications using Neon.

## [Real-Time API](/real-time-api/)
You can access the data Neon generates in real-time and remote control it using its Real-Time API. Learn how it works here!

## [Recording API](/recording-api/)
Neon recordings are fully open and accessible. You can inspect and process the raw data of all data streams using our Recording API. Learn how it works here!

## [Open-Source Libs](/open-source-libs/)
Pupil Labs in mainting a number of open-source tools and libraries to support the Neon ecosystem. Make use of them to speed up your development process!
