# Swapping Frames

Many [different frames](https://pupil-labs.com/products/neon/shop) are available for the Neon module, which enables the usage of Neon in various applications. 

All you need to do is to loosen the two screws fixating the Neon module into the nest of the first frame, plug the module into the nest of the second frame, and tighten the screws again. The screwdriver needed for this is a Hex 1.5.
