# Companion Device
The Companion device is a flagship Android smartphone. It is a regular phone that is not customized or modified in any way. To ensure maximum stability and performance we can only support a small number of carefully selected and tested models. The Neon Companion app is tuned to work with these particular models as we require full control over various low-level functions of the hardware. 

The model we currently support are Motorola Edge 40 Pro.

If you want to replace or add an extra Companion device you can purchase it [directly from us](https://pupil-labs.com/products/neon) or from any other distributor. The Neon Companion app is free and can be downloaded from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pupillabs.neoncomp).

Using a fully charged OnePlus 10 device you get around 4 hours of continuous recording time. You can extend this duration by simultaneously charging the phone during a recording [using a powered USB-C hub](/hardware/using-a-usb-hub/).
