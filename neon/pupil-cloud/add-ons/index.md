# What Are Add-ons?
Pupil Cloud Add-ons allow you to selectively upgrade services for your eye tracking device. Add-ons can be purchased through the Pupil Labs [website](https://pupil-labs.com/products/cloud/pricing). Each add-on is bound to a Neon device.

# Register an add-on
Typically registering an add-on can be done by clicking on a link that we send in an email when you purchase the add-on.

To manually register an add-on: 

1. Click on the top right account avatar in the navigation bar, and then “Account Settings”
2. In the Cloud Add-ons tab, click on “Register Add-on”
3. Enter your activation key and your activation date
4. Confirm your add-on activation

# Devices

## Link a device

Add-ons must be linked to at least Neon eye tracking device. If you have an Add-on with multiple devices, you can add more than one eye tracking device. After adding your add-on, click Link device in the table. Find your device ID from your Companion App; if your device has been added or has been used to make a recording in a Workspace you own, it will automatically show up in the dropdown.

## Devices view

The Devices view shows devices that have uploaded to any workspace that you own. Here you can check how much storage each device that has uploaded to your workspaces has used out of your quota. 

You can also see workspaces to which your device has uploaded by double clicking on the device in the table, and jump to that workspace.

1. Register your Anonymization add-on (see Registering an add-on)
2. Link your device to the add-on
3. [Create a workspace] with Face Blurring **On**. Important note: you can not undo this option after a workspace has been created. 
4. Upload to that workspace.
