# What Are Cloud Plans?

Pupil Cloud offers different plans to fit your needs:
- **Free Plan:** Lets you explore Pupil Cloud and run small-scale studies with two hours of active analysis
- **Unlimited Analysis Plan:** Built for comprehensive research, this plan unlocks unlimited active analysis and supports multiple devices for labs, universities, and enterprise projects.

You can purchase or configure your plan through the [Pupil Labs website](https://pupil-labs.com/products/cloud/pricing).

Plans are registered to a single user account, and an Unlimited Analysis Plan can be configured to support one or
multiple eye tracking devices. You can also enhance your plan with optional features, like Anonymization.

Active analysis refers to the duration of recordings that can be processed through Pupil Cloud’s analysis and visualization 
pipelines.

## Activate Your Plan and Features

Your plan and any additional features need to be registered with your user account. This can be 
done by clicking the link sent in your purchase confirmation email.

## Link Your Devices to a Plan

Liking a device or devices to your plan unlocks the benefits of the plan for those devices.

Click 'Link device' in the table. The drop-down menu will contain 
the serial numbers of all devices that have previously uploaded recordings to your workspaces. You can also obtain the 
serial of a new device via the Companion app and enter it here.

The Devices view shows all devices that have uploaded to workspaces you own. Here you can check which plan each device 
is linked to (Free or Unlimited) and monitor storage.

You can also check the workspaces each device has uploaded to by double clicking on a device in the table.

## Sharing Your Plan's Benefits

### Workspace Management

You can create multiple [workspaces](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/neon/pupil-cloud/workspaces/) within the user account that your plan is registered to. This allows you to share the 
benefits of your Unlimited Analysis Plan (and privacy features if appropriate) with collaborators without them needing to purchase their own plan.

### Inviting Users

You can invite other users to [join your workspaces](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/neon/pupil-cloud/workspaces/). As part of your workspaces, invited users can, for example, 
view, edit, enrich, and download recordings based on the role assigned to them.

### Device Access

Other users can also log into the [Companion App](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/neon/data-collection/ecosystem-overview/#neon-companion-app) on the device linked to your plan using their own accounts. They 
can then upload recordings to your workspaces, thereby benefiting from your plan's features.
