A project is a set of recordings that are grouped for joined processing and analysis. You create projects from the Recordings view in Drive by selecting one or more recordings and clicking "create project from recording". You can also add projects to existing recordings.

Within a project, you can annotate recordings with events and create [enrichments](/pupil-cloud/enrichments/) to power your analysis.
