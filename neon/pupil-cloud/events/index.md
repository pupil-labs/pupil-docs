# Events

You can create post-hoc events in the timeline to annotate key points in each recording. Post hoc events can be moved and deleted. Events are scoped to the Workspace. Learn more about Events [here](../../data-collection/events/index.md#Events).

If you have a lot of events, you may find the search feature useful for filtering events visible in the timeline.
