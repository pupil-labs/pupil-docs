# Recordings

A recording starts and stops when you press the record button in the Neon Companion app. While this should feel similar to recording a regular video on your phone, there is a lot more happening behind the scenes. When you are recording with the Neon Companion app, you are capturing not only video data but several more sensors (see [Data Streams](/data-collection/data-streams/)).

Recordings are designed to be as robust as possible. If at any point the Neon module is temporarily disconnected from the Companion phone, it will automatically start capturing again as soon as it is reconnected. You could start a recording with no Neon connected and plug it in at a later time. As soon as it is connected, data will be captured.

The Neon Companion app has several more features to ensure robust data collection and will e.g. warn you in case the Companion device's battery is running low or if you run out of storage space.

## Events, Wearers, & Templates

When making a recording you can capture various additional data to record things like metadata or key events that happened during data collection. These will be saved as part of the recording itself.

[**Events**](/data-collection/events/) are key points in time in a recording that have been marked.

[**Wearers**](/data-collection/wearers/) are the people who wear the Neon device while recording.

[**Templates**](/data-collection/templates/) are questionnaires that can be filled out at recording time.
