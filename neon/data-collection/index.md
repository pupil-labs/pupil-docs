# Data Collection with Neon
Data collection is a key step for any application of Neon! In this section you can learn everything about it, starting with how to make [your first recording](/data-collection/first-recording/)!

You can find an overview of what data is contained in Neon recordings inclduing all the [data streams](/data-collection/data-streams/) from the various sensors, as well as any additional data like [events](/data-collection/events/), [wearers](/data-collection/wearers/), and [templates](/data-collection/templates/).

You can find introductions on how to use the Neon Companion App, e.g. on [Offset Correction](/data-collection/offset-correction/), and how-to guides on common tasks during data collection, e.g. [Time Synchronization](/data-collection/time-synchronization/).

Documentation on useful software and integrations for data collection is also available, see e.g. [Monitor App](/data-collection/monitor-app/) or [Lab Streaming Layer](/data-collection/lab-streaming-layer/).

Finally, you can find a list of [troubleshooting](/data-collection/troubleshooting/) tips and tricks for common issues during data collection.
