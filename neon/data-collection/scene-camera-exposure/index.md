# Scene Camera Exposure
The [scene cameraâ€™s](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/neon/data-collection/data-streams/#scene-video) exposure modes can be adjusted to improve image quality in different lighting conditions. There are four modes:

- **Manual:** This mode lets you set the exposure value manually.
- **Automatic**: `Highlights`, `Balanced`, and `Shadows` automatically adjust exposure according to the surrounding lighting.

::: tip 
The mode you choose should depend on the environment. The images below provide an example and some caveats.

## Changing Exposure Modes

From the home screen of the Neon Companion app, tap the [Scene and Eye Camera preview](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/neon/data-collection/first-recording/#_4-open-the-live-preview).
- Tap on `Balanced` to reveal all four modes 
- Tap on the desired mode

## Manual Exposure Mode

`Manual` mode allows you to set the exposure time between 1 ms and 1000 ms. 

::: tip 
**Note:** Exposure duration is inversely related to camera frame rate. Exposure values above 330 ms will reduce the scene camera rate below 30fps.

## Automatic Exposure Modes

**Mode: `Highlights`**
![This mode optimizes the exposure to capture bright areas in the environment, while potentially underexposing dark areas.](Highlight.webp)
`Highlights`- optimizes the exposure to capture bright areas in the environment, while potentially underexposing dark areas.
   
**Mode: `Balanced`**
![This mode optimizes the exposure to capture brighter and darker areas in the environment equally.](./Balance.webp)
`Balanced` - optimizes the exposure to capture brighter and darker areas in the environment equally.

**Mode: `Shadows`**
![This mode optimizes the exposure to capture darker areas in the environment, while potentially overexposing bright areas.](Shadow.webp)
`Shadows` - optimizes the exposure to capture darker areas in the environment, while potentially overexposing bright areas.
