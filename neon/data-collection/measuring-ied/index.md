# Measuring the Inter-Eye-Distance (IED) of a Subject

The Inter-Eye-Distance (IED) can be adjusted for applications requiring precise pupillometry or eye-state measurements. These adjustments do not require prior calibration of the device. However, the accuracy of Neon’s 3D eye-state and pupil-size measurements can be enhanced by correctly setting the IED for each wearer.

To add the participant’s IED, input the value into their ‘Wearer Profile’ within the Neon Companion app before starting a recording. By default, the IED is set to 63 mm, which is the average for adults.

Please follow the simple steps below to measure the participant’s IED:

- Ask the person to look at a distant object (to avoid eye convergence).
- Hold the ruler in front of the person’s eyes and measure from the center of one pupil to the center of the other.
