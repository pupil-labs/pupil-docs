# Measuring the Inter-Eye-Distance (IED)

The wearer's IED can be set in the Neon Companion app for applications requiring 
precise pupillometry or eye-state measurements. 
This does not require prior calibration of the device. However, the accuracy of Neon’s 3D eye-state and pupil-size 
measurements can be enhanced by correctly setting the IED for each wearer.

To add the wearer's IED, input the value into their ‘Wearer Profile’ in the Neon Companion app before 
starting 
a recording. The default IED is set to 63 mm, which is the average for adults.

Here's a simple way to measure IED:
1. Ask the person to look at a distant object (to avoid convergence)
2. Hold a ruler in front of their eyes and measure from the center of one pupil to the center of the
other
