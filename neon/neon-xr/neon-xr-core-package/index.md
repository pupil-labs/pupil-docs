# The Neon XR Core Package
Using Neon XR Core Package in your Unity project enables you to receive eye tracking data from a Neon device over the local network in real-time.

## Adding Neon XR to Your Project
The [**Neon XR Unity package**](https://github.com/pupil-labs/neon-xr) enables you to receive eye tracking data from a Neon module in your Unity project in real-time. 

To integrate it in your project, follow these steps:

1. Add the `Neon XR` package in the Package Manager.
    1. Select `Window -> Package Manager`
    2. Select `+ -> Add Package from git URLâ€¦`
    3. Insert ` https://github.com/pupil-labs/neon-xr.git?path=/com.pupil-labs.neon-xr.core`.
1. If your project does not use Addressables, create default Addressables settings.
    1. Select `Window -> Asset Management -> Addressables -> Groups`.
    2. Click on `Create Addressables Settings`.
    3. If legacy bundles are detected click on `Ignore`.
1. Select `Pupil Labs -> Addressables -> Import Groups`. After this step the `NeonXR Group` should appear in the `Addressables Groups` window (you can open this window again following step 2.1).
1. In the `Addressable Groups` window, select `Build -> New Build -> Default Build Script`.
1. Copy the `NeonXR` prefab from the imported package into the scene.
1. Locate the `Neon Gaze Data Provider` component on GameObject `NeonXR/PupilLabs`.
1. Add your own listener for the `gazeDataReady` event (see for example, `GazeDataVisualizer.OnGazeDataReady`).

## Connecting to Neon
The Neon Companion App publishes the data it generates to the local network using the [real-time API](/real-time-api/tutorials/). The Neon XR Core package contains a client to receive this data and map it into the 3D virtual world. By default, it tries to connect the first Neon device it detects on the network.

Thie behavior can be further configured by editing the `config.json` file of the app, which is located at the following path:
```
\Android\data\com.MixedRealityToolkitOrganization.MRTK3Sample\files\config.json
``` 

It contains a field `rtspSettings` with the following keys:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `autoIP` | Enables the automatic discovery of Neon devices connected to the local network. The first detected device will be used. |
| `deviceName` | If not empty, only devices with the provided name can be discovered. |
| `ip` | The IP address that will be used if automatic discovery is disabled. |
