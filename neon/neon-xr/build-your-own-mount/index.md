# Build Your Own Mount for Neon
If you want to integrate Neon into a headset that we do not support yet, you can build your own mount! Thanks to the small form factor of the Neon module, this is possible for a wide range of headsets. The only requirement is that the headset provides a sufficient amount of space to place the Neon module such that it sits correctly above the wearers nose. Especially for headsets that are  compatible with regular glasses, this is typically the case.

The process consists of two steps, 1) building the mount and 2) calibrating the mount inside of the headset.


## Building the Mount
Similar to how you might [design a regular frame](/hardware/make-your-own-frame/) for Neon, you need to build the mount around the "Bare Metal" frame, which includes the "nest" PCB and USB cable.

To help you get started, we provide CAD models of the Neon module and Bare Metal frame [here](https://github.com/pupil-labs/neon-geometry). A model of the "Just act natural" frame is also included as a template to kickstart your design process!

You need to design your mount in auch a way that 1) the Neon module does not move in relation to the headset and 2) the module sits correctly above the wearers nose, similar to how it would sit using the "Just act natural" frame.
