## Data Format

Every time you click record in Pupil's capture software, a new recording is started and your data is saved into a recording folder. It contains:

* `world.mp4` Video stream of the world view
* `world_timestamps.npy` 1d array of timestamps for each world video frame.
* `info.csv` a file with meta data
* `pupil_data` pupil data serialized with [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/). This is used by Pupil Player.
* Other files - depending on your hardware setup and plugins loaded in Pupil Capture, additional files are saved in your recording directory. More on this later.

These files are stored in a newly created folder inside `your_pupil_recordings_dir/your_recording_name/ XXX` where `XXX` is an incrementing number. It will never overwrite previous recordings!

If you want to view the data, export videos, export raw data as `.csv` (and more) you can use [Pupil Player](#pupil-player).

Splitting the timestamps from the actual video file has several benefits:

* Timestamps can be stored as list of floats instead of storing them in a video format specific time specification, i.e. time base / PTS combinations.
* Efficient access to all timestamps. Reading a float array from file is magnitudes faster than demuxing the whole video file and converting the format specific PTS back to floats.
* The video file becomes a simple list of frames. The frames' indices correspond to their timestamps' indices in the `*_timestamp.npy` file. A frame's index can simply calculated by calculating `PTS * time_base * average_rate`. This allows Pupil Player to seek by frame indices instead of using timestamps. See [`file_backend.py`](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil/blob/master/pupil_src/shared_modules/video_capture/file_backend.py) for more information.
Summarizing, it allows us to synchronize multiple data streams using an intuitve timestamp format. With Pupil Player exported videos will have their PTS set correctly according to each frame's timestamp.

### Pupil - Data Format
The data format for Pupil recordings is 100% open. Sub-headings below provide details of each file and its data format.

#### World Video Stream
When using the setting `more CPU smaller file`: A `mpeg4` compressed video stream of the world view in a `.mp4` container. The video is compressed using ffmpeg's default settings. It gives a good balance between image quality and files size. The frame rate of this file is set to your capture frame rate.

When using the setting `less CPU bigger file`: A raw `mjpeg` stream from the world camera world view in a `.mp4` container. The video is compressed by the camera itself. While the file size is considerably larger than above, this will allow ultra low CPU while recording. It plays with recent version of ffmpeg and vlc player. The "frame rate" setting in the Pupil Capture sidebar (Camera Settings > Sensor Settings) controls the frame rate of the videos.

> You can compress the videos afterwards using ffmpeg like so:

```
cd your_recording
ffmpeg -i world.mp4  -pix_fmt yuv420p  world.mp4
ffmpeg -i eye0.mp4  -pix_fmt yuv420p  eye0.mp4
ffmpeg -i eye1.mp4  -pix_fmt yuv420p  eye1.mp4
```

> OpenCV has a capture module that can be used to extract still frames from the video:

```python
import cv2
capture = cv2.VideoCapture("absolute_path_to_video/world.mp4")
status, img1 = capture.read() # extract the first frame
status, img2 = capture.read() # second frame...
```

#### Coordinate Systems
We use a normalized coordinate system with the origin `0,0` at the bottom left and `1,1` at the top right.

* Normalized Space

  Origin `0,0` at the bottom left and `1,1` at the top right. This is the OpenGL convention and what we find to be an intuitive representation. This is the coordinate system we use most in Pupil. Vectors in this coordinate system are specified by a `norm` prefix or suffix in their variable name.

* Image Coordinate System

  In some rare cases we use the image coordinate system. This is mainly for pixel access of the image arrays. Here a unit is one pixel, origin is "top left" and "bottom right" is the maximum x,y.

#### Timestamps
All indexed data - still frames from the world camera, still frames from the eye camera(s), gaze coordinate, and pupil coordinates, etc. - have timestamps associated for synchronization purposes. The timestamp is derived from `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` on Linux and MacOS.

The time at which the clock starts counting is called PUPIL EPOCH. In pupil the epoch is adjustable through `Pupil Remote` and `Pupil Timesync`.

Timestamps are recorded for each sensor separately. Eye and World cameras may be capturing at very different rates (e.g. 120hz eye camera and 30hz world camera), and correlation of eye and world (and other sensors) can be done after the fact by using the timestamps. For more information on this see [Synchronization](#synchronization) below.

Observations:

- Timestamps in seconds since PUPIL EPOCH.
- PUPIL EPOCH is usually the time since last boot.
- In UNIX like, PUPIL EPOCH is usually **not** the Unix Epoch (00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970).

More information:

- Unit : Seconds
- Precision: Full float64 precision with 15 significant digits, i.e. 10 μs.
- Accuracy:
   - If WIFI, it is ~1 ms
   - If wired or 'localhost', it is in the range of μs.
- Granularity:
   - It is machine specific (depends on clock_monotonic on Linux). It is constrained by the processor cycles and
     software.
   - In some machines (2 GHz processor), the result comes from clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &time_record)
     function on Linux. This function delivers a record with nanosecond, 1 GHz, granularity. Then, PUPIL software does
     some math and delivers a float64.
- Maximum Sampling Rate:
   - Depends on set-up, and it is lower when more cameras are present. (120Hz maximum based on a 5.7ms latency for
     the cameras and a 3.0ms processing latency.

#### Pupil Data
We store the **gaze positions**, **pupil positions**, and additional information within the `pupil_data` file. The `pupil_data` file is a Python dictionary serialized with [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/).

#### Pupil Positions
Coordinates of the pupil center in the eye video are called the **pupil position**, that has x,y coordinates normalized as described in the coordinate system above. This is stored within a dictionary structure within the `pupil_data` file.

#### Gaze Positions
The **pupil position** get mapped into the world space and thus becomes the **gaze position**.  This is the current center of the subject visual attention -- or what you're looking at in the world. This is stored within a dictionary structure within the `pupil_data` file.

### Looking at the data

#### Data Visualizer in Player
Head over to [Pupil Player](#pupil-player) to playback Pupil recordings, add visualizations, and export in various formats.

#### Access to raw data
Use the 'Raw Data Exporter' plugin to export `.csv` files that contain all the data captured with Pupil Capture.

An informational file that explains all fields in the `.csv` will be exported with the `.csv` file for documentation.
Below is a list of the data exported using `v0.7.4` of Pupil Player with a recording made from Pupil Capture `v0.7.4`.

#### pupil_positions.csv
* `timestamp` - timestamp of the source image frame
* `index` - associated_frame: closest world video frame
* `id` - 0 or 1 for left/right eye
* `confidence` - is an assessment by the pupil detector on how sure we can be on this measurement. A value of `0` indicates no confidence. `1` indicates perfect confidence. In our experience useful data carries a confidence value greater than ~0.6. A `confidence` of exactly `0` means that we don't know anything. So you should ignore the position data.
* `norm_pos_x` - x position in the eye image frame in normalized coordinates
* `norm_pos_y` - y position in the eye image frame in normalized coordinates
* `diameter` - diameter of the pupil in image pixels as observed in the eye image frame (is not corrected for perspective)
* `method` - string that indicates what detector was used to detect the pupil

optional fields depending on detector
in 2d the pupil appears as an ellipse available in `3d c++` and `2D c++` detector

* `2d_ellipse_center_x` - x center of the pupil in image pixels
* `2d_ellipse_center_y` - y center of the pupil in image pixels
* `2d_ellipse_axis_a` - first axis of the pupil ellipse in pixels
* `2d_ellipse_axis_b` - second axis of the pupil ellipse in pixels

#### Data made available by the `3d c++` detector
* `diameter_3d` - diameter of the pupil scaled to mm based on anthropomorphic avg eye ball diameter and corrected for perspective.

* `sphere_center_y` - y pos of the eye ball sphere
* `sphere_center_z` - z pos of the eye ball sphere

### Raw data with Python
You can read and inspect `pupil_data` with a couple lines of python code.

```python
import msgpack

data = None
with open("/path/to/pupil_data", "rb") as f:
    data = msgpack.unpack(f, encoding='utf-8')
```

### Synchronization

Pupil Capture software runs multiple processes. The world video feed and the eye video feeds run and record at the frame rates set by their capture devices (cameras). This allows us to be more flexible. Instead of locking everything into one frame rate, we can capture every feed at specifically set rates. But, this also means that we sometimes record world video frames with multiple gaze positions (higher eye-frame rate) or without any (no pupil detected or lower eye frame rate).

In `player_methods.py` you can find a function that takes timestamped data and correlates it with  timestamps form a different source.

```python
def correlate_data(data,timestamps):
    '''
    data:  list of data :
        each datum is a dict with at least:
            timestamp: float

    timestamps: timestamps list to correlate  data to

    this takes a data list and a timestamps list and makes a new list
    with the length of the number of timestamps.
    Each slot contains a list that will have 0, 1 or more associated data points.

    Finally we add an index field to the datum with the associated index
    '''
    timestamps = list(timestamps)
    data_by_frame = [[] for i in timestamps]

    frame_idx = 0
    data_index = 0

    data.sort(key=lambda d: d['timestamp'])

    while True:
        try:
            datum = data[data_index]
            # we can take the midpoint between two frames in time: More appropriate for SW timestamps
            ts = ( timestamps[frame_idx]+timestamps[frame_idx+1] ) / 2.
            # or the time of the next frame: More appropriate for Sart Of Exposure Timestamps (HW timestamps).
            # ts = timestamps[frame_idx+1]
        except IndexError:
            # we might loose a data point at the end but we don't care
            break

        if datum['timestamp'] <= ts:
            datum['index'] = frame_idx
            data_by_frame[frame_idx].append(datum)
            data_index +=1
        else:
            frame_idx+=1

    return data_by_frame
```
