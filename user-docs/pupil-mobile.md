### Introducing Pupil Mobile

> {{< video-youtube embed-url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/atxUvyM0Sf8" >}}

Pupil Mobile enables you to connect your Pupil eye tracking headset to your Android device via USBC. You can preview video and other sensor streams on the Android device and stream video data over a WiFi network to other computers (clients) running Pupil Capture. Seamlessly integrated with Pupil Capture and Pupil Service.

The communication protocol is named [NDSI](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyndsi/blob/master/ndsi-commspec.md), it is completely open. A reference client for Python exsits [here](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyndsi).

<aside class="notice">
For this to work your network needs to allow `UDP` transport. If the nodes do not find each other, create a local wifi network and use that instead.
</aside>

<aside class="warning">
The communication protocol does not implement any access control. This means that everyone running Pupil Capture in
your local network will be able to access, i.e. stream and record, sensors connected to the phone running Pupil Mobile!

Make sure to hit "Stop background servie and terminate app" in the general Pupil Mobile settings after you are done.
