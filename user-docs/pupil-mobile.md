### Streaming To Subscribers

> {{< video-webm src="/videos/backend-manager/backend-manager.webm" >}}

Pupil Mobile devices on the same local WiFi network are automatically detected by Pupil Capture. To subscribe to a Pupil Mobile device in Pupil Capture, go to `Capture Selection` and select Pupil Mobile as the capture source.

#### WiFi Bandwidth & Network

Make sure you have a good WiFi newtork connection and that it's not saturated. The quality of your WiFi connection will affect the sensor streams to your subscribers.

<aside class="notice">
Note - For streaming to work your network needs to allow <code>UDP</code> transport. If the nodes do not find each other, create a local wifi network and use that instead.
</aside>

<aside class="warning">
Make sure that your firewall is not blocking the connection.
</aside>

### NDSI Communication protocol

The communication protocol is named [NDSI](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyndsi/blob/master/ndsi-commspec.md), it is completely open. A reference client for Python exsits [here](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyndsi).

<aside class="warning">
The communication protocol does not implement any access control. This means that everyone running Pupil Capture in your local network will be able to access, i.e. stream and record, sensors connected to the phone running Pupil Mobile!

Make sure to hit "Stop background service and terminate app" in the general Pupil Mobile settings after you are done.
