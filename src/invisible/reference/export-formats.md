# Export Formats

## General Information
All [enrichments](/invisible/explainers/enrichments) are defined on specific sections of recordings using events. Every enrichment export contains a `sections.csv` file summarizing the available sections as follows:

| Field | Description | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| **section id** | Unique identifier of the section.     |
| **recording id** | Unique identifier of the recording this section belongs to.     |
| **recording name** | Name of the recording this section belongs to.     |
| **wearer id** | Unique identifier of the wearer used in the corresponding recording.     |
| **section start time [ns]** | Timestamp corresponding to the start event of the section. Given as UTC timestamp in nanoseconds.     |
| **section end time [ns]** | Timestamp corresponding to the end event of the section. Given as UTC timestamp in nanoseconds.     |
| **start event name** | Name of the start event of the section.     |
| **end event name** | Name of the end event of the section.     |

Further, every enrichment export contains a file called `enrichment_info.txt`, which contains the name of the enrichment type, a link to the appropriate documentation, and the version of the enrichment that was used.

## Gaze Overlay

#### Video Files
The export will have one folder per original recording using the following naming scheme:
```<recording name>-<start of recording ID>```

Each folder contains gaze overlay videos of the sections belonging to the corresponding recordings. The video files are named
```<beginning of section ID>_<start time>-<end time>.mp4```
where the times are in seconds relative to the recording start.



## Binary Recording Data
If you download recording data straight off of the phone without uploading to Pupil Cloud first, you will receive raw binary data. This data is difficult to handle and we do not recommend you use it directly. If using Pupil Cloud is not an option for you, please [export the data via Pupil Player](/core/software/pupil-player/#export) to convenient formats instead. Note that the formats used by Pupil Player are not the same as in Pupil Cloud.

You can find the format documentation of the raw binary data [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e1Xc1FoQiyf_ZHkSUnVdkVjdIanOdzP0dgJdJgt0QZg/edit?usp=sharing). Please note that the raw data format may change without advance notification.
