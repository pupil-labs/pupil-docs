# Attach the Head Strap

The [head strap](https://pupil-labs.com/products/invisible/accessories/) is an accessory that can be purchased if you want to use Pupil Invisible while playing sports or in other dynamic activities. The head strap can be adjusted to fit most wearers by pulling the two tabs.

Clip the strap connector onto the arms of your Pupil Invisible glasses. The cable should be on top of the glasses' arms. The open side of the clip should be on the inside of the glasses frame. See the image for reference.
