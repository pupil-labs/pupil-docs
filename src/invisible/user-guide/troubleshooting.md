# Troubleshooting
**The scene camera and eye cameras are not being recorded or recognized in the companion app!**

1. Make sure the headset is connected to the companion device using the
   included USB-C to USB-C connector cable. Note that other 3rd party
   USB-C to USB-C cables might not work robustly.
2. Make sure **OTG** is enabled. If it is not enabled you should see a red USB sign in the top-left of the companion app's home screen. You can find instructions on how to enable it [here](/invisible/user-guide/invisible-companion-app/#enable-otg "Pupil Invisible Companion OnePlus Enable OTG").

**The scene video or gaze data cuts off at some point in a recording!**

1. Make sure the **companion app is locked** to the Android app overview. If it is not locked, you should see a red lock symbol in the top-left of the companion app's home screen. You can find instructions on how to lock the app [here](/invisible/user-guide/invisible-companion-app/#enable-application-lock "Pupil Invisible Companion OnePlus App Lock").
2. Make sure that permissions to access the USB devices are given and **"Use by default for this device" is enabled**. If those permissions are not given or not set to be used by default, you should get prompts asking you for permissions every time you reconnect the glasses to the companion device. Thus to fix this reconnect your glasses and for every prompt that shows up give permission and check the "Use by default for this device" checkbox.
3. Make sure you are using the included black USB-C to USB-C connector
   cable rather than another 3rd party cable. Such cables are available
   in a wide variety of quality and using cables of insufficient quality
   can lead to loss of connection.

**A red LED is blinking on my Pupil Invisible glasses!**

The LED is indicating that there is a problem that may affect further data collection and tries to grab your attention. To get details on what the problem exactly is open the Pupil Invisible Companion app, which will show an error description.

The potential problems incude:
- Low battery on the Companion device.
- Little storage left on the Companion device.
- Unstable connection to the Pupil Invisible device during a recording.
