# Exchange the Lenses
You can easily change the lenses of your Pupil Invisible glasses. A pair of shaded lenses is included with every device.

You can get custom lenses with specific prescription values at any optician. Alternatively, you can purchase a [lens kit](https://pupil-labs.com/products/invisible/accessories/) from the Pupil Invisible accessories.

You will hear a _pop_ sound when the lens is removed or inserted. Don't worry - the frame and lenses are durable!
