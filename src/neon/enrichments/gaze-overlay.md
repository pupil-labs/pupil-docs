## Gaze Overlay
<div class="pb-4" style="display:flex;justify-content:center;">
  <v-img
    :src="require('../../media/invisible/explainers/gaze_overlay_header1.jpg')"
    max-width=100%
  >
  </v-img>
</div>

The Gaze Overlay enrichment allows you to download world videos with a gaze overlay rendering. You can easily filter out the sections of your recordings you are interested in and the visualization of the gaze circle can be customized (currently: size and color).
