## Raw Data Exporter
Using the Raw Data Exporter you can get access to all your recording data in convenient CSV and MP4 format directly from Pupil Cloud. Easily export entire projects and extend your analysis with your own custom tools (R, Python, etc.) or third-party analysis platforms. In addition to the raw recording data, it also includes event annotations you have added post hoc.

Currently, the events used for defining this enrichment are fixed to `recording.begin` and `recording. end`. It is not possible to limit the export range using other events similar to other enrichments.
