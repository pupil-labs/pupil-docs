Calibrating Neon's IMU is essential for accurate orientation readings.

To perform a calibration, begin by starting a recording in the Neon Companion App (this initialises the IMU), and then perform the calibration choreography for approximately 30 seconds. For a visual demonstration, please refer to the video above.

Note that once a calibration is performed, you can stop and start recordings without needing to recalibrate. However, if Neon remains stationary for an extended period, we recommend recalibrating the IMU.

::: tip
**Note:** As an optional step, you can use our [real-time IMU visualization tool](https://github.com/pupil-labs/plimu) along with a compass to assess the accuracy of your calibration. This tool necessitates familiarity with executing a script from the command line.
