# Clean and Disinfect

Neon contains cameras and sensitive electronic components, do not rinse or wet-clean.

- Glasses lenses can be cleaned with the provided microfiber cloth.
- Scene camera and eye camera lenses can be carefully cleaned with the provided microfiber cloth if dust is visible.

### Disinfecting Frames
All Neons are cleaned with a disinfectant before shipping. You may want to disinfect the frames between uses.

The disinfectant we use is made from 22.0g Ethanol, 21.0g 2-Propanol, 8.0g 1-Propanol per 100 grams of solution. One such brand name that we use is "Vibasept". We use the wetted towelettes (wipes). Similar products should be available globally under different brand names.

[TODO: How much caution do we need in regards to water damage?]

When cleaning, be careful around the eye cameras, world camera, and USB connection. Liquid from disinfectant might damage sensitive electronics inside the frame.
