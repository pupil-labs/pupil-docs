# Swapping Frames

Many different frames are [available](https://pupil-labs.com/products/neon/specs/#frame-specs) for the Neon module, which enables the usage of Neon in various different applications. You can easily detach the Neon module from one frame and attach it to another. 

All you need to do is to loosen the two screws fixating the Neon module into the nest of the first frame, plug the module into the nest of the second frame, and tighten the screws again. The screwdriver needed for this is a <!-- [TODO: fill in screwdriver type Phillips H5?]. -->

<!-- [TODO: Insert images of module in nest and module with loose screws detached from the nest. Alternatively a short video.] -->

# Bare Metal Frame
If you would like to proptotype your own frame we also offer the Bare Metal option, which includes the minimum required components to attach the Neon module to your own frame, a "nest" and a cable to connect it to the phone.

You may want to check the 3D models if you plan on designing your own frame. You can find them [here](https://github.com/pupil-labs/neon-geometry)
