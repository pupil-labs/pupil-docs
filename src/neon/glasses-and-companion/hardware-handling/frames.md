# Swapping Frames

Many different frames are [available](https://pupil-labs.com/products/neon/specs/#frame-specs) for the Neon module, which enables the usage of Neon in various different applications. You can easily detach the Neon module from one frame and attach it to another. 

All you need to do is to loosen the two screws fixating the Neon module into the nest of the first frame, plug the module into the nest of the second frame, and tighten the screws again. The screwdriver needed for this is a Hex 1.5.

## Design your own Frame
You can design your own custom frame and integrate Neon into whichever form factor you want. To support this, we offer the "Bare Metal" frame, which only includes the "nest" PCB and USB cable. These are the only components you need to operate the Neon module and you can design your custom frame around them.

CAD models of the Neon module and nest are available [here](https://github.com/pupil-labs/neon-geometry). A model of the "Just act natural" frame is also included as a template to kickstart your design process!
