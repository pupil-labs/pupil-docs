# Welcome to Alpha Lab!

[insert image that is generated with stable diffusion/similar or something from r&d with a bunch of eyeballs in a grid. If going the generated route, include a caption with the prompt. The image should look cool and a bit weird. It doesn’t need to be permanent. We could even have multiple images that cycle on each reload. It should signal signal a bit of playfulness (serious-play), technical chops, and openness]

Pupil Labs is made up of people who are curious by nature. We are researchers, designers, toolmakers, and professional tinkerers. We enjoy building quick prototypes and demos to explore our curiosities. We built Alpha Lab so that we can have a centralized place to collect the results of our explorations and to share it with the world.

Alpha Lab is not a place for official product documentation. Everything you find here should be considered a work in progress, and may even be a bit rough around the edges. That is the nature of exploration!

We encourage you to read through the results and go further - play around, build from the ideas here, hack away!
Sharing is caring
Some of the prototypes and demos you see here came from our own home-grown curiosities. Others were inspired by questions from you - members of our community - via discussion on [discord](discord link?)].

If you have an idea that you want us to explore [let us know](canny). It could be a demo of using our existing tools, or an out of the box idea that combines some new state of the art deep learning pipeline with eye tracking.
Show and tell
Enough talk; let’s dive in.

[One card per demo/prototype with caption - image for each]
Netflix and fixate: Here we show you how you can use Pupil Invisible + Pupil Cloud’s Reference Image Mapper to map gaze onto dynamic on screen content - like a video.

AOIs: Here we demonstrate how to make areas of interest using data downloaded from Pupil Cloud’s Reference Image Mapper.

RIM Room: We pushed the limits of markerless mapping with Pupil Clou’s Reference Image Mapper - scanning an entire apartment.
