# <font size=4>Eye blinks: artifacts and information</font>

The accurate detection of eye blinks serves a vital role in numerous eye tracking applications. Its importance is twofold: firstly, it helps identifying time periods affected by blink-related artifacts, and secondly, isolating key physiological, cognitive, and clinical parameters, such as blink rate and blink duration. Blink detection can even be utlizied in order to control external devices, for example by detecting a sequence blinks made in quick succession. In order to show you how to achive all of this, we have put together this guide.

# <font size=4>Running blink detection locally</font>

Eye blinks are automatically detected once your recording is uploaded to Pupil Cloud. This guide shows how to apply Pupil Labs' blink detection algorithm <i>offline</i> (i.e., without using Pupil Cloud) to recordings made with Pupil Invisible or Neon or <i>in real-time</i> (using [Pupil Lab's Realtime Python API](https://github.com/pupil-labs/realtime-network-api)). This allows you to build novel applications or simply satisfy your curiosity and develop a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms.

::: tip
If your are interested in learning more about the technical details of the underlying blink deteciton pipeline, we also invite you to have a look at our [**white paper**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JLBhC7fmBr6BR59IT3cWgYyqiaM8HLpFxv5KImrN-qE/export?format=pdf).

# <font size=5>Getting started</font>

To get started, we invite you to check out the accompanying [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/pupil-labs/real-time-blink-detection). There you can find a detailed instruction on how to install all required packages as well as a [**Jupyter notebook**](https://github.com/pupil-labs/real-time-blink-detection/blob/main/blink_detection.ipynb) that contains all the code needed and instructions on how to run everything.

If you don't have a Pupil Invisible or Neon recording at hand, worry not! The GitHub repository comes with an example recording (made with Neon) that you can explore.

<strong>Part 1: Posthoc blink detection</strong>

Once you have run the first part of the notebook, you will get an output from which you can derive a number of statistics that provide various insights about your recording: the total number of detected blinks, the estimated blink rate (in Hz), and the average blink duration (in seconds), as well as eyelid closing and re-opening durations (in seconds).

You will additionally get a visual representation of the detected blinks, providing an overview of the temporal distribution of the detected blinks:

When examining blink durations and the eyelid closing and re-opening times, you may notice that the total blink duration doesn't consistently equate to the sum of the durations of the closing and re-opening phases. This discrepancy arises because there are some frames during the period between closing and reopening of the eyelids where there is negligible movement, and thus, they are not classified as part of either the opening or the closing phase. However, blink duration is calculated from the start time of the eyelid closing to the last frame identified as part of the re-opening sequence and will, thus, almost always be marginally longer than the sum of the individual events.<br>

# <font size=3><strong>Part 2.1.: Real-time blink detection</strong></font>

In the first section of Part 2 of the guide, you will learn how to estimate blink rate in quasi real-time. From this, you will obtain a graph, as shown below, that is updated with every blink and shows an estimate of the current blink rate.

# <font size=3>Part 2.2.: Toggling recordings remotely through eye blinks</font>

In the last section of the guide, you will learn how to control a Neon or Pupil Invisible device through a rapid sequence of three eye blinks. Upon detection of said sequence, the companion device will initiate a new recording or stop an ongoing one, as illustrated in the video below:

# <font size=5>Conclusion</font>
In this Alpha Lab, we have shown you how you can use our blink detection pipeline, both offline as well as in real-time, and how you can build simple applications with it. We're excited to see what you will build using these tools.
