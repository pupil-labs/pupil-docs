# Invisible

Welcome to Pupil Invisible developer docs!


## Recording Format

Pupil Invisible Companion stores its data files in pairs: 
Each data file has a corresponding timestamp file. This
is required to correlate the different data source after-the-effect in Pupil Cloud or
Pupil Player.

You can find details to the specification of the Pupil Invisible Companion app recording
format in this [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e1Xc1FoQiyf_ZHkSUnVdkVjdIanOdzP0dgJdJgt0QZg/edit?usp=sharing).

## Network API

[Pupil Invisible Companion App](/invisible/user-guide/invisible-companion-app/) uses
the [NDSI v4](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyndsi/blob/v1.0/ndsi-commspec.md) protocol
to publish its scene video and gaze data via local network.

[Pupil Invisible Monitor](#pupil-invisible-monitor) desktop application uses this API to
list the local devices, receive their scene video, and visualize the most recent gaze data.

Below you can find a full example that receives gaze data from all available Pupil
Invisible Companion devices:

```py
import time

# https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyndsi/tree/v1.0
import ndsi  # Main requirement

GAZE_TYPE = "gaze"  # Type of sensors that we are interested in
SENSORS = {}  # Will store connected sensors


def main():
    # Start auto-discovery of Pupil Invisible Companion devices
    network = ndsi.Network(formats={ndsi.DataFormat.V4}, callbacks=(on_network_event,))
    network.start()

    try:
        # Event loop, runs until interrupted
        while network.running:
            # Check for recently connected/disconnected devices
            if network.has_events:
                network.handle_event()

            # Iterate over all connected devices
            for gaze_sensor in SENSORS.values():
                # Fetch recent sensor configuration changes,
                # required for pyndsi internals
                while gaze_sensor.has_notifications:
                    gaze_sensor.handle_notification()

                # Fetch recent gaze data
                for gaze in gaze_sensor.fetch_data():
                    # Output: GazeValue(x, y, ts)
                    print(gaze_sensor, gaze)

            time.sleep(0.1)

    # Catch interruption and disconnect gracefully
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
        network.stop()


def on_network_event(network, event):
    # Handle gaze sensor attachment
    if event["subject"] == "attach" and event["sensor_type"] == GAZE_TYPE:
        # Create new sensor, start data streaming,
        # and request current configuration
        sensor = network.sensor(event["sensor_uuid"])
        sensor.set_control_value("streaming", True)
        sensor.refresh_controls()

        # Save sensor s.t. we can fetch data from it in main()
        SENSORS[event["sensor_uuid"]] = sensor
        print(f"Added sensor {sensor}...")

    # Handle gaze sensor detachment
    if event["subject"] == "detach" and event["sensor_uuid"] in SENSORS:
        # Known sensor has disconnected, remove from list
        SENSORS[event["sensor_uuid"]].unlink()
        del SENSORS[event["sensor_uuid"]]
        print(f"Removed sensor {event['sensor_uuid']}...")


main()  # Execute example
```

## Events

Events allow external triggers/annotations to be mixed into the Pupil Invisible recording data stream.

A source for triggers/annotations could be another app that you develop running on the Pupil Invisible Companion Device. Your app might have buttons that the wearer can press. Button presses translate into events that are written into the Pupil Invisible recording data stream. Another source might be a script that runs a PC in the same local network.

When events are received or generated by the Pupil Invisible Companion app they are written to `events.raw/events.time` and also published on the NDSI events sensor.


### Event Data Format

Event datums contain two fields:
1. Name: A UTF-8 encoded string of up to 1024 chars length. Events with an identical string may repeat in the datastream  
2. Timestamp: Timestamp of the Event in Pupil Time

### Event Network Interface

Events can be sent to Pupil Invisible Companion app via a Zyre message. Minimal example below:

```py

import pyre
import json

event_message = {
    "name": "your event name",
    "timestamp": None
    # timestamp (optional)  time in nanoseconds.
    # if omitted Pupil Invisible Companion will use the time of message reception    
}

node = pyre.Pyre("event_source")
node.join("pupil-mobile-v4")
node.start()
try:
    for evt in node.events():
        if evt.type == "JOIN":
            # send an event to every PI Companion App
            # and other NDSIv4 actor that joins the pupil-mobile-v4 group
            node.whispers(evt.peer_uuid, json.dumps(event_message))
            print(f"sent event {event_message} to: {evt.peer_name}")
except:
    node.stop()
```

A more sophisticated example that also shows how to receive events from the PI companion can be found in the [PI time sync](##-time-synchronization) section of the docs.


## Time Synchronization

The Pupil Invisible Companion App runs its own clock as the source for all data timestamps it generates. To create this clock the App samples the phone’s NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronised UTC clock (Android Framework's `System.currentTimeMillis() * 1e6`) once at the beginning of the first sensor stream initialization. From then onward until no more sensors are streaming, this app clock is used, the unit used is nanoseconds.

Unlike the phones wall clock, this App clock is guaranteed to be monotonic, it also has a higher resolution. We can utilize the benefits of the initial NTP synchronization to make Pupil Invisible synchronisable with other devices that also follow NTP.

**To check sync quality:**
1) Send a notification without timestamp to the companion app.
2) Measure the round-trip-time till reception of the echo.
3) Compare the timestamp in the echo with your target time while taking into account the round-trip-time.

        # Event loop, runs until interrupted
        while network.running:
            # Check for recently connected/disconnected devices
            if network.has_events:
                network.handle_event()

            # Iterate over all connected devices
            for event_sensor in SENSORS.values():
                # Fetch recent sensor configuration changes,
                # required for pyndsi internals
                while event_sensor.has_notifications:
                    event_sensor.handle_notification()

                sent_time_ping(network, event_sensor)  # Send <<time>> event
                recv_time_echo(event_sensor)  # wait for echo, calculate time offset

        network.whisper(

            roundtrip = event_time_received - event_time_send
            time_diff = (event_time_received + event_time_send) / 2 - event_time_phone

            print(f"[{host_name}] Round trip time: {roundtrip} seconds")

        print(f"Added sensor {sensor}...")

## Pupil Invisible Monitor

This is a stand alone desktop app that connects to Pupil Invisible using the Network API
over WiFi. You can use it to live stream scene video and gaze data from all connected
Pupil Invisible(s) on the network.
